# Model weights and checkpoints
# IMPORTANT: Pre-trained weights (.pth files) are REQUIRED for running demos (see README)
# The code loads weights from:
#   - Large-scale-single-pixel-imaging/weights/*.pth
#   - image-free-segmentation/weights/**/*.pth  
#   - image-free-object-detection/logs/*.pth
# 
# If weights are too large (>100MB), consider:
#   1. Using Git LFS: git lfs track "*.pth"
#   2. Providing download links in README
#   3. Uncommenting the line below to ignore them
#
# *.pth  # Uncomment ONLY if weights are too large and you'll provide separate download

# Ignore other large model formats and training checkpoints
